## Detailed descriptions C03 list

### C03 / ex00

Here we reproduced the functionalities from the strcmp (string compare) function. This function compare the content of two strings and show the equal parts from the strings.

### C03 / ex01

The same functionalities from the function strcmp, but here we pass a 'n' parameter that will limit the comparation position between the two strings.

### C03 / ex02

Here we reproduced the functionalities from the strcat function.

### C03 / ex03

Here we reproduce the same functionalities from the above function, but limiting the concatenation by the 'n' parameter.

### Important notes

We are now searching and reviewing the whole code from the exercises of this list, because some of them have bugs and errors but we already didn't know where. This will be reviewed and remade, if you want to contribute, you can clone the repository and open a pull request with the fix and explanation.
