In this basecamp we were challenged to recreate functions of C programing language, and scripts of Shell.
The experience at 42 was really amazing and i was grateful by being part of it, here you would find
exercises of C and Shell lists.

This repository is free for everyone to see and contribute, for new campers seeking for help and different
points of view to develop the exercises.

The C lists are not complete, here we just have some of the exercises that i made (it will be updated by the time).
Is free and under no license for a while.

## How it works / where to find?

The functions are presented in the C directories, the main of each C functions/exercises are presented on the directory called testesC.
The Shell scripts are presented at Shell directories.

And for the last but not less important we have the Rush files, presented at Rush00 directory.
The Rush project was made in a weekend by groups of three campers sorted in each group, the objective was
to develop a prototype of a function to print some characters in diferent orders on the screen.

## Improvements to come

I will finish the other exercises of 42sp lists and add them here, actually i'm still configuring my setup to code in C, because by now i'm a Windows boy, but i'll change that ("I promise"), and i'll try to improve my actual code, cause in the C03 list exists some errors and bugs that i'll fix. And made the code better looking and in shape for a better performance.

## Bugs

In C03 exercise, it presents some bugs that would be fixed soon.
