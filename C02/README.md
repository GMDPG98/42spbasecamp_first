## Detailed descriptions C02 list

### C02 / ex00

In the C02 list we start to see more advanced things, the entire list is made of exercises where we should reproduce functions from string.h library in C.

This first exercise we were challenged to reproduce the function strcpy (string copy), where the function should copy the content of one string and put into another.

### C02 / ex01

In this exercise we need to reproduce the function strncpy (string n copy), where the functionalities is really closer to the strcpy function, the difference is presented in the n from the name, that represents the amount of characters that will be copied from one string to another, this number will be defined in the tests.

### C02 / ex02

We need to create a function that will return the value 1 if the string passed as parameter just have alphabetic characters or if the string is empty, and 0 value if the string passed as parameter have another characters.

### C02 / ex03

Here we have the same objectives as the exercise above, but now we had to check if the string is numeric, now returning 1 if the string only contains numbers or is empty, and returning 0 if the string contains other character types.

### C02 / ex04

The same type of the exercises above, but now we should just verify if the string have only alphabetic lowercase characters, if does then we should return 1 and also if the string is empty. Then if the string have another type of character the function should return 0.

### C02 / ex05

Here we just should verify if the string contains uppercase characters, the same rules as listed above, if uppercase or empty then return 1, if not then return 0.

### C02 / ex06

The same as the others, but here we will verify if the string is printable, returning 1 if the string just contain printable characters or empty, and 0 if doesn't.

### C02 / ex07

Here we need to create a function that will transform all the characters from a string in uppercase, returning the string value.

### C02 / ex08

Here we need to create a function that will transform all the characters from a string in lowercase, returning the string value.
