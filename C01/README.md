## Detailed descriptions C01

### C01 / ex00

Here we started to learn a little about pointers, in this exercise we were challenged to create a function that would pass a pointer as a parameter and give it a value of 42.

- Different from the C00 list, in C01 list all functions, included write, are forbidden.

### C01 / ex01

In exercise 01 we were challenged to create a function that would have a pointer of a pointer nine times, pointing to an int passed as parameter, and we need to change the value of int to 42.

### C01 / ex02

In this exercise we need to swap the value of two int variables with pointers passed as parameter of the function.

### C01 / ex03

Here we need to create a function that divide two parameters a and b and keep the results in the int variable pointed by div variable.

The function also keep the rest of the division between a and b and keep the value in the variable mod.

### C01 / ex04

The difference between this exercise and the ex03 above is that in this exercise the values of division between a and b will be keeped in int pointed by a, and the rest of the division will be keeped in int pointed by b.

### C01 / ex05

Here we were challenged to create a function to show the characters of a string one by one.

In this exercise we were allowed to use the function write to print the characters of string.

### C01 / ex06

In the ex06 we will count the length of the string and show the size of it.

No allowed functions.
